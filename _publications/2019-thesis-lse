excerpt: 'This is a thesis completed for the fullfillment of the MSc in Enviromental Economics and Climate Change, 
at the London School of Economics (2019).  
This research investigates the impact of the rollout of the Integrated Marketplace
in the Southwest Power Pool (SPP) on residential electricity prices, conditional on the
structure of the utility providing electricity services. This research seeks to test whether 
there is a causal implication between firm structure and residential pricing after the introduction 
of a wholesale electricity market.'
