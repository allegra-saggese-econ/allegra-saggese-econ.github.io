title: "Innovation, Growth and the Environment"
collection: publications
category: other
excerpt: 'Economic development is fundamentally about productivity growth.
Productivity growth occurs mostly as the result of innovation, broadly
defined. This includes technological, organisational, social, and political
innovations. Innovation is held back by a combination of ‘market failures’
and ‘government failures’. This paper explores the research frontier in development economics 
related to climate change, adaptation, and the environment, and the subsequent innovations to support
sustainable development.'
